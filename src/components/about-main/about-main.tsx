              <p>
                Hey there I&apos;m Indeevar Duhan. My story starts in the early
                90s in Delhi, India. My early years were colourful, intriguing,
                sometimes chaotic and often blissful. The bliss continued when I
                landed in Aotearoa/New Zealand at the age of 18 and I fell in
                love with the place. So much so, that now I call it home. I am a
                Registered nurse with experience spanning almost a decade. My
                work has been entirely aged care related and it has been a truly
                life changing experience. Resilience of our older generation has
                humbled me many times and their life experiences have left me
                inspired. Their wisdom is enlightening, and their warmth can be
                felt when you hold their hand. It drives me to continue to work
                with them in community and home care environment where they
                cherish their homes and families. At Signature health, our goal
                is to provide excellent healthcare to our clients in the comfort
                of their homes. We cater to unique need of each individual and
                consistently work with them to understand their changing needs.
                We aspire to become largest and most trusted home care provider
                in New Zealand in the coming years.
